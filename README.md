# üÉè Example Gameplay

To give you a glimpse of the gameplay, here's an example of a round in the Space Oddity card game:

1. The game starts with the red light turning on, indicating the beginning of a round.

2. Each player takes turns playing cards and triggering their respective effects. For example, a player may play "The Switcher" card, causing the LED light to switch from blue to red and moving the hidden red black hole ring to a different player's deck.

3. Players strategically play cards and form pairs of the same element to discard them. For instance, a player may match two "Sneak a Peek" cards, allowing them to look at the next person's deck and select a card of their choice.

4. As the game progresses, players aim to be the first to run out of cards. Each turn brings anticipation and excitement, as the "Black Hole" card gets closer to being revealed.

5. The game ends when one or more players successfully discard all their cards. These players are declared the winners. However, the player left with the "Black Hole" card in hand is considered the loser.

The Space Oddity card game offers a unique blend of chance, strategy, and bluffing, making each round an engaging and enjoyable experience for all players involved.
